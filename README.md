# DMC-FS50
Panasonic Lumix DMC-FS50 EEPROM dump

This is the EEPROM dump taken when the camera is in init mode. See [Service Manual](https://elektrotanya.com/panasonic_dmc-xs1.pdf/download.html), section 3.4.2, page 9.

## Notes

- DMC-FS50 is similar to DMC-XS1
- In some regions it is DMC-FH10
- These files can be flashed back to the camera

## But... why?

- On other Lumix models people have modified these files to [change the language of Japanese cameras to English](https://www.dpreview.com/forums/thread/4672435), but the camera needs to remain in init mode so will display ⚠️ when it is powered down
- There might be a way to give the DMC-FS50 the Creative Control shooting modes seen on the DMC-XS1
